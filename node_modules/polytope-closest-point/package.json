If no such point can be found, it returns Number.NaN\n\nNotes:  For polytopes with fewer than 4 vertices, the code uses hand optimized routines derived from WildMagick.  For higher dimensions, it falls back to a general purpose quadratic programming solver that is ported from somewhat slower R/FORTRAN codes.  If you are planning on using this code to do distance queries on meshed surfaces, it is recommend you triangulate all your polygons first.\n\nCredits\n=======\nTriangle/tetrahedra closest point code derived from WildMagick (c) David Eberly 1998-2012.\n\nOther dimensions, (c) 2013 Mikola Lysenko\n\nBOOST License.\n",
